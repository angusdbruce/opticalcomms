After developing the photoresist, the p-contact was metalised by evaporation deposition with Ti/Au 20/200$nm$. The back contact was then metalised by the same process with Ni/Au/Ge/Ni/Au 5/88/12/12/35$nm$.

After deposition, the metal was annealed by rapid thermal anneal at $400\degree C$ for 30 seconds. Annealing may be done for many reasons. It can reduce the resistance of the metal-semiconductor junction by reducing the trap density. The effect of this was not directly measured as the I-V response of contacts was not measured prior to annealing.
