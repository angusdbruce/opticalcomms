Prior to spinning the photoresist for both the p-contact and the mesa etch, the substrates were cleaned to ensure that there was no contamination on the surface and to ensure that the photoresist was deposited correctly.

The cleaning process comprised of 3 minutes in an ultrasonic bath each for OptiClear, acetone and isopropanol (IPA) to remove any particles or organic compounds on the substrate surface. Special attention was given when transferring the substrate from the acetone to the IPA so that the acetone did not dry out and leave a residue. The substrate was then rinsed briefly in RO water before being dried thoroughly by the N2 gun. Lastly the substrate was ashed in an oxygen plasma for 3 minutes at 150W.
