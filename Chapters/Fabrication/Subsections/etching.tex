Before etching, the depth of the resist was found to be $2022nm$ by the stylus profiler. The exposed areas of the substrate were wet etched for 60 seconds using a H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$:H$_{2}$O$_{2}$:H$_{2}$O 1:8:40 solution. The resist depth was measured again and found to be $2273nm$ giving an etch depth of $251nm$. Since the thickness of the p+ GaAs contact layer is $150nm$, the etch will have gone $101nm$ into the p-InGaAsP layer assuming the layer thicknesses are exact.

Another etching process is dry etching where the etchant is either a gas or plasma. Dry etching can have a slower etch rate and poorer selectivity than wet etching.
