\label{sec:intro}

An LED emit photons due to the recombination of electrons and holes when a potential difference is applied across it. LEDs are almost always made from a direct bandgap semiconductor such as GaAs as the recombination rate is higher due to the probability of a phonon, electron and hole being in close proximity is lower in an indirect bandgap semiconductor such as silicon. The wavelength of light produced by an LED depends largely on its bandgap. Using InGaAsP and altering the ratios, the bandgap can be tailored. Using InGaAsP and other direct bandgap semiconductors, LEDs are able to produce a wide range of wavelengths ranging from infrared through visible to ultraviolet.

The applications of LEDs in the world today are as useful as they are varied. In the home, LEDs provide energy-efficient long-lifetime lighting, far outperforming traditional incandescent bulbs. Due to their high ratio of optical power to area, it is possible to make high-resolution displays and screens from them. They are used in streetlights, reducing their running cost and carbon footprints. Small LEDs can be switched on an off very quickly making them suitable for using in optical communication systems. Since it is possible to engineer LEDs with tight wavelengths, LEDs can be useful in wavelength division multiplexing which can vastly increase the bandwidth of a given channel.

This report details the manufacture and testing of a red GaAs LED.
