% Plot the output light power as a function of forward bias for one of your LEDs (or the standard). Describe the salient features of the graph. [150 words max + Figures].

The optical power was measured against current from $0mA$ to $300mA$. As described in section \ref{sec:test:apparatus}, the power measured is not the total output power but a fraction. The results measurements are plotted in \ref{fig:li}. This figure shows the optical power increase from $0mA$ to $220mA$ before decreasing again as the current increases to $300mA$. The peak power is not of any particular interest since it is not absolute but the current at which it occurs, $220mA$, is.
