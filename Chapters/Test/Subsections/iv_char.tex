Figure \ref{fig:iv} shows the forward and reverse current plots for this LED. The forward voltage turns on at $1.8V$ and increases to $2.5V$ at $300mA$. The reverse voltage doe not show a great deal. The voltage was limited to a range of $-5V$ to $5V$ and the first data point at $-1mA$ required more than $-5V$. As such, it shows a $-5V$ for all measured currents.
