The emission spectra of the LED are plotted in figure \ref{fig:spectrum}. The spectrum was measured at $50mA$, $175mA$ and $300mA$. All plots are normalised to better understand the differences in spectrum. The peak optical power is around a wavelength of $630nm$. The exact peak is difficult to determine due to the noise on the measured signal, see figure \ref{fig:spectral_close}, but can be estimated to be approximately $627nm$, $629nm$, and $632nm$ for $50mA$, $175mA$ and $300mA$ respectively. Even without a precise value, it is clear that there is a trend that the peak wavelength increases with the current. It is also noticeable that the lower the current, the tighter the wavelength is around its peak.
