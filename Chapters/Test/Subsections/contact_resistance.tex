Figures \ref{fig:ctlms_iv} shows the I-V plot for all gap size measurements from the circular transfer length method (CTLM). The CTLMs had a radius of $200\mu m$ and gap sizes from 5 to $50\mu m$ in steps of $5\mu m$. The plots for all gap sizes are close to linear implying that the contacts have an ohmic response.

The average resistance for each gap was found and plotted against the gap sizes, see figure \ref{fig:ctlm_res}. The true gap sizes were not measured and are assumed to be exactly as designed. Due to the nature of CTLMs, the radii of the two contacts cannot be equal. It is therefore necessary to include a correction factor which is found using equation \ref{eq:correction}

\begin{equation}
  C = \frac{1}{R_1}ln(\frac{R_1 + S}{R_1})
  \label{eq:correction}
\end{equation}

When the line of best fit for the corrected resistance values, shown in red, on figure \ref{fig:ctlm_res} are extrapolated it is found that the resistance values when the gap size is $0\mu m$ the resistance is $0.659\Omega$. This is equivalent to $2R_c$.
